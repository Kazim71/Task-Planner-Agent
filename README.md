## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built with Python and FastAPI that leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to function as an intelligent task planner. Users can input a high-level goal, and the agent will use a sophisticated "two-pass" system to generate a structured, day-by-day plan.

The agent is designed to be versatile, capable of creating everything from technical learning roadmaps to detailed travel itineraries. It intelligently decides when to use external tools like web search (Tavily) and weather forecasting (OpenWeatherMap) to enrich its plans with real-time, relevant data.

## Key Features

* **Intelligent AI Agent:** Uses a "two-pass" thinking process to first select the right tools and then generate an informed plan.
* **Dynamic AI Personas:** The agent's instructions (system prompt) can be easily modified to make it an expert in any domain (e.g., a travel agent, a fitness coach, a career advisor).
* **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with external APIs for web search and weather to create fact-based, relevant plans.
* **Full-Stack Application:** Built with a robust FastAPI backend and a clean, responsive HTML/JavaScript frontend.
* **Database Persistence:** Saves all generated plans to a database (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production) for later viewing.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Deployed on Railway with a continuous deployment pipeline triggered by pushes to the main GitHub branch.

AI Usage Disclosure
This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools. AI was used for generating boilerplate code, debugging, and as an intellectual sparring partner to refine logic and explore solutions, particularly during the implementation of the agent.py and the refactoring of the main.py file. All code was reviewed, tested, and customized by the human developer to fit the project's specific requirements and ensure quality.
