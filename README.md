## Overview

Task Planner Agent is a full-stack web application built with Python and FastAPI that leverages Google's Gemini AI to function as an intelligent task planner. Users can input a high-level goal, and the agent will generate a structured, day-by-day plan, enriched with real-time web search and weather data.

The agent is versatileâ€”capable of creating everything from technical learning roadmaps to detailed travel itineraries. It intelligently decides when to use external tools like Tavily (web search) and OpenWeatherMap (weather) to enrich its plans.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent AI Agent:** Uses a "two-pass" thinking process to select the right tools and generate informed plans.
- **Dynamic AI Personas:** Easily modify the agent's instructions to make it an expert in any domain (travel, fitness, career, etc.).
- **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Tavily (web search) and OpenWeatherMap (weather) for fact-based, relevant plans.
- **Full-Stack Application:** Robust FastAPI backend and clean, responsive HTML/Jinja2 frontend.
- **Database Persistence:** Saves all generated plans to a database (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production).
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Deployed on Railway with continuous deployment from GitHub.
